I have always had an exceptional memory. Since I was a kid, I have been able to recall memories and past experiences from years prior down to the last, minute detail. The colors of clothes people wore, the show playing on the TV in the background, the exact song on the radio, even the arbitrary smell drifting from the kitchen. I was remembering it all,  but I never understood how. People would ask me constantly: “How do you possibly remember that?” I had no answer. It just happened. Like the time we were circling the parking lot next to the primary school I attended. Something about the almost purplish color of the night sky flicked a switch in my brain and suddenly I was back there, nearly ten years earlier, sitting in my exact seat by the wall when my teacher walked over in her purple pullover to tell me my mum had come to pick me up early. I could see the rays of the sun shining from the floor of the hallway, with light green stripes along the bottom of the walls, leading to the gate that opens up to the exact parking lot. The memory was so vivid it felt like I had traveled back in time. But I said nothing. What would be the point? It was just another random memory surfacing, another moment no one else would find significant. 

 

For years, I did not pay attention to this trait of mine. I just had a great memory. But as I grew up, these flashbacks started to happen more frequently, impossible to ignore. And then I started to recognize patterns. 

Flashbacks weren’t random. The memories I recalled shared something in common with the present. I saw this clearly in the lower part of the Balkan Mahallesi, a neighborhood where my father would take us on extended drives whenever we didn't want to go home yet. Years later, the smallest ray of sunlight shining into my cornea, the slightest bump on the road takes me to those car rides.  

This understanding pushed me towards researching my gift. That is when I came across the actual science behind my memory. As it turns out, our experiences are not stored like files on a computer, they're encoded as interconnected networks of sensory information. Scientists call these "retrieval cues": Sensory inputs that form pathways to reach different points of long-term memory. Richer the clues, stronger the pathway gets.  

 

But there was more. Researches on memory consolidation, particularly studies by neuroscientists like James McGaugh and Larry Cahill, revealed that the act of remembering itself strengthens memories. Every time you call a memory, you rebuild the pathway in between, increasing the likelihood that you will recall that memory again. 

A scientific example to this is the Godden and Baddeley experiment, conducted in 1975 by Duncan R. Godden and Alan D. Baddeley. During the experiment, researchers had scuba divers learn a list of words in two different contexts: underwater and on land. Participants were asked to recall the words they have been told in either the same or a different environment that they have been told. The results showed that recall was better when learning and recall contexts matched. The environment was encoded along with the words. This is what I was experiencing. I was connecting sensory input together and then accessing the rest of the chain one by one.  

 

Understanding the neuroscience of my memory fundamentally changed how I see myself. I always thought my memory was static, a box that we throw our experiences in. As it turns out, this box is getting bigger and bigger each time we throw something in.  Every time I pay attention to certain details, I am actually adding more identity to a certain moment. The more sensory cues I encode, more pathways I build to that moment, the easier it gets to find my way back. My memory is more dynamic than I thought it was. 

This realization gave me something I didn't know I had: agency. I'm not just passively experiencing life with better recall than others. I'm actively choosing what stays vivid and what fades. Now when I’m experiencing a moment worth going back, I try to collect as many details from my surroundings as possible. This way, my identity is not just shaped by what happens to me, it's constructed from what I choose to encode, what I decide to revisit, which memories I strengthen by recalling them. Understanding the science did not just explain my gift, it gave me the ability to lay pathways to certain moments I, or my brain finds interesting.  The purple pullover, the parking lot, the sunlight in the hallway; these aren't just fragments my brain happened to capture. They're moments I unconsciously chose to preserve in high definition. And now that I understand the mechanism, and I've realized I'm not a library storing memories, but an architect who's been building corridors back to specific rooms my entire life.
